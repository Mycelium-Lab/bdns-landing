                                economy too. NODs elicit the potential to configure your Ethereum wallet address to
                                the most prestigious names on the Blockchain. Over time, the exclusivity of a NOD
                                will translate into a more prestigious wallet address than any other on the
                                Blockchain, the same way as a Tier 1 city address has done so in the physical world.

If you want to get to know us better, you can come and meet us in person on any of our social media platforms.

                            <p class="lng-faq-scam">A BDNS is the real deal but don't take our word for it if you're uncomfortable. Take your time, contact us directly, attend one of our live social media chats, meet the team and the founders, and only once you're convinced that we are here to stay should you buy a NOD. We are pretty sure you'll be satisfied that BDNS is for real if you follow all these steps.

                            <p class="lng-faq-updates">Yes! In fact, one of the things that we are most excited about is building on top of NODs to create even more amazing applications. Building great software and partnering with like-minded developers are the main reasons we love Blockchain so much, so creating next-generation BDNS tools is our main priority alongside community development.

                            <p class="lng-faq-partners">We love great software and we want to build great solutions. This means that we will partner with both larger and smaller software providers.  We see the emergence of so much new software in Blockchain currently coming from unknown brands as being some of the most exciting aspects of web3 development. Equally, the scale and reach that larger Blockchain platforms have is appealing to us in terms of community development prospects. If you have a really cool product and are interested to partner with BDNS but are afraid we may not have heard of you yet, reach out to us by e-mail or contact us on any of our social media platforms.
